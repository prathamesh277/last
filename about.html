    It is very easy to use. Healthcare refers to the organized provision of medical care to people and communities. By that definition, healthcare careers do not just include doctors, nurses, and other frontline clinicians who often come to mind first when people think of healthcare jobs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Due to its size and diversity, healthcare welcomes new professionals with many different skills, interests, and personalities. In general, people who work in this sector have hearts to serve others and intellectual interests in math and science.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some healthcare professions require many years of formal education. Anesthesiologists, surgeons, and ophthalmologists, for instance, need up to 12 years of higher education. However, other healthcare professionals need only a few months to start their careers. Students can earn certifications in high-demand fields such as EKG tech and cardio-phlebotomy tech in about 10-21 weeks. Prospective healthcare professionals can learn more about careers and degrees in the field on this website.</p>
